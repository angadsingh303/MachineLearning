The Supreme Court on Wednesday questioned the mandatory use of Aadhaar card for drawing pension by 
retired government employees, reported IANS. Aadhaar is a 12-digit personal identification number 
issued by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI)- as mentioned on the official 
website of UIDAI- uidai.gov.in. Supreme Court said that pension is not a subsidy but an 
entitlement of a person for years of service he/she has rendered to the government in discharge of
official duties, IANS further reported. A five judge constitution bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra, Justice Sikri, Justice A.M. Khanwilkar, Justice D.Y. Chandrachud and Justice Ashok Bhushan is hearing
the batch of petitions challenging the constitutional validity of Aadhaar Act on the touchstone of the fundamental right to privacy.
