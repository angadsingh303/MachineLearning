Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla Motors and SpaceX, has said that making rockets and electric cars were two of the 
‘dumbest’ possible business ventures he got into.
Speaking in Austin, Texas, the technocrat said that he hunts for things that don’t seem to be working but are 
important for our life and future.
"If you were to do a risk-adjusted rate of return estimate on various industry opportunities, I would put building 
rockets and cars pretty much at the bottom of the list," USA Today quoted him.
Talking about SpaceX, he said that he always wondered why we were not progressing the way we should have. “I just kept wondering why we were not making progress towards sending people to Mars.
 Why we didn’t have a base on the moon. Where are the space hotels that were promised in the movie 
(2001: A Space Odyssey)?" he said.
